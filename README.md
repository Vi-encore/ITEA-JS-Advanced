# ITEA-JS-Advanced

Fifth HW from JS-Advanced block in ITEA. My task was to work with window.location 
to change URL,  to do RestAPI equest to APi, witch provide fake users data. Then I add this info to page 
in corresponding styling. And I did pagination thing. After clicking to button (1-5) URL changes (adds page=1 etc).
