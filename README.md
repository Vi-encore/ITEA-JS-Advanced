ITEA-JS-Advanced
Third HW from JS-Advanced block in ITEA. My task (var 1) was to work width localStorage, 
save data, if checkbox 'rememder me' checked and display name in header. After reloading page - name stays in header, 
fields in form filed with data.
If checkbox not checked - delete all data from localStarage.
